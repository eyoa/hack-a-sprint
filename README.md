# Hack-A-Sprint

## Introduction

Hack-A-Sprint is a club where developers can come together and learn web development through a hands-on approach by building projects. These projects are relaxed and non-competitive so you can go on your own pace and experiment with other tools without the stress of a due date or evaluation. 

## How does it benefit you?

Hack-A-Sprint will help you gain knowledge about basic web development subjects and give you experience on working with a team. You will gain a better understanding of version control and how to work with other peoples' code. We hope that after doing one or two projects, you will gain enough confidence to tackle the hackathons or other projects or prospects that you might have.

## How does it work?

1. Every challenge spans from 3-4 weeks where each week has a certain amount of tasks that we do for that specific week
2. In the beginning of the challenge, we'll present a short intro about the club, the project, and give out the first set of tasks
3. Your team will then start building the project and work on those tasks as best as you can
4. In the next 2-3 weeks, we'll meet up again to have a quick stand-up meeting where teams can demo their progress or ask for help. In the end of those meetings, we'll give out the next set of tasks
5. In the last week or when participants feel that they finish their projects, they can submit and share their product in a LinkedIn post where you will:
    - Write about what you did
    - Tag @Mintbean
    - Paste a link to your repo on Github
5. You will then share that LinkedIn post in the Discord #show-off channel

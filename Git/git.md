# Git
Git is a software that allows developers to work collaboratively on a codebase. It tracks changes and offers features like "branching" to test new additions to the code without changing the main branch directly.

## Version Control
* [Branching]()
* [Pull Request]()
* [Merge Conflict]()

## Basic Git Commands
* [git add]()
* [gid commit]()
* [git revert]()
* [git log]()
* [git status]()

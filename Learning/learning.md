# Learning
Resources for learning the tools and frameworks used in the projects

## Front-End
### React
* [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). Highly interactive and allows you to write code on the same screen as the tutorials. The course does use class components rather than functional components, but it can be a good practice to convert the projects to use functional components instead.
* [React Hooks Documentation](https://blog.ohansemmanuel.com/react-hooks-documentation-easy-to-read/). `useEffect` and `useState` are the ones you'll be using the most, but the other hooks are useful as well. 
### Next.js
### SASS
* [Sass Basics](https://sass-lang.com/guide). Documentation from the main website. Short and straight to the point.

## Back-End
### Node
### Express
### MongoDB
